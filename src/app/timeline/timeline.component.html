      <p> During this Traineeship, I learned programming in Java.
      The training consisted of two parts. The first one focussed on learning Java from the very basics and
      ended with passing the Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 (OCA) exam. In the second part of the training
      we build a web application. Constructing this application was done by using frameworks such as Spring Boot and Angular. </p>

        <p> While doing my master's, I worked as a Student Assistent on two courses, both on Computational Linguistics.
        These courses taught students the basics of programming in Python, as well as how to use Python as a tool to study Linguistics.
        I taught work groups of up to fifteen students, starting from "Hello world" and ending with building their own Named Entity Recognizer.</p>

      <p>2014 - 2019</p>
      <p> I have been tutoring from the first year of my bachelor's to the last year of my master's. While it was mostly private tutoring
      high school students in subjects such as mathematics, Dutch, and English, I also did tutoring in linguistics, statistics, and mathematics
      to university students. </p>
